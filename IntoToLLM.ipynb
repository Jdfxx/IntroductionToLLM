The wewa stretches out besides the village's rice paddies for 175-acres (708,200 sq m) and is filled with the rainwater of preceding months.    \\n\\nSiriwardene, the 76-year-old secretary of the village's agrarian committee, has a tightly-guarded ritual to perform. By boiling coconut milk on an open hearth beside the tank, he will seek blessings for a prosperous harvest from the deities residing in the tree. \\\"It's only after that we open the sluice gate to water the rice fields,\\\" he told me when I visited on a scorching mid-April afternoon.\\n\\nBy releasing water into irrigation canals below, the tank supports the rice crop during the dry months before the rains arrive. For nearly two millennia, lake-like water bodies such as this have helped generations of farmers cultivate their fields. An old Sinhala phrase, \\\"wewai dagabai gamai pansalai\\\", even reflects the technology's centrality to village life; meaning \\\"tank, pagoda, village and temple\\\".\"\n",
